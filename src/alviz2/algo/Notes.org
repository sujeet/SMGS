				Notes

* What is node.cost? Is it f (n) or g (n)??
* What is pruneCount? Number of children NOT in CLOSED 
** If all children are in CLOSED, you are prunable.
* pruneClosedList - why do we not use just the OPEN list? Why use open-closed list?
** The only effects seem to be to add the <node, parent/ancestor> pair in parents and make the ancestor a relay node.
* Are there some nodes in both OPEN and CLOSED?
